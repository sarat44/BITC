                    Software Development Life Cycle
                </b></h1>
                <p>
                  Various activities that perform from beginning to the end is called as SDLC. 
				  A software development lifecycle is essentially a series of steps, or phases, 
				  that provide a model for the development and lifecycle management of an application.
				  <p>
				  <h3>Stages in SDLC:</h3><p>
1.	Requirement gathering <p>
2.	Analysis<p>
3.	Design<p>
4.	Implementation or coding<p>
5.	Testing<p>
6.	Deployment & Maintenance <p>

<h3  style="color:#EC9A82        ;">Requirement gathering: </h3>
Business requirements are gathered in this phase. This phase is the main focus of the project managers and stake holders.

<h3>The Task of Business Analyst:</h3>
Interacts with the customer to gather requirements using the template BRS and submit that template back to the company to make sure that they are on the same page.

<h3 style="color:#EC9A82          ;"> Analysis:</h3>

A detailed study of the requirements is done in order to check if they are feasible or not.
<p><b>User Requirements:</b> Describe the tasks the user must be able to accomplish the product.
It is captured in use case diagrams and scenario descriptions
System Requirements: Detailed software description which can serve as the basis for design or implementation. 
<p><b>Tentative planning: </b>The resource, as well as the time, is temporarily planned here
<p><b>Technology Selection: </b>The technologies that are required for accomplishing the projects successfully are analyzed and listed off.

<h3 style="color:#EC9A82        ;">Design:</h3><p>
In this phase,the technical details of the design are discussed with the stakeholders and various parameters such as risks, technologies to be used, the capability of the team, project constraints, time and budget are reviewed and then the best design approach is selected for the product.
<p>System Design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining overall system architecture. The system design specifications serve as input for the next phase of the model.
<p>In this phase, the testers come up with the Test strategy, where they mention what to test, how to test.

<h3 style="color:#EC9A82        ;">Coding: </h3>
<p>Developers have to follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers etc are used to generate the code.
 Different high-level programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, Java, and PHP are used for coding. The programming language is chosen with respect to the type of software being developed.

 <h3 style="color:#EC9A82        ;">Testing:</h3>
<p>After the code is developed it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the product is actually solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements phase. 
During this phase, all types of functional testing like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, 
acceptance testing are done as well as non-functional testing are also done.
<p>White Box testing: It is a program based testing to estimate the completeness and Correctness of the internal logic of each program structure. It is also known as clear box testing, open box testing, logic driven testing or path driven testing or structural testing and glass box testing.
<p>Black box testing: It is software based testing to estimate the completeness and Correctness of the external functionality of the application. It is also called as Functionality, Behavior, Requirement based or closed box testing.

<h3 style="color:#EC9A82        ;">Deployment and Maintenance:</h3>
<p>Once the software has been fully tested and no high priority issues remain in the software, it is time to deploy to production where customers can use the system.
<p>Once a version of the software is released to production, there is usually a maintenance team that looks after any post-production issues.



				  
				<p>
                  Some of the SDLC Models are
				</p>

<p>1. Waterfall Model </p>
<p>2. Prototyping model</p>
<p>3. Incrementing/Overlapping Waterfall Model</p>
<p>4. Spiral Model</p>
<p>5. V-Model</p>
<p>6. Agile model</p>
<p>7. RAD Model</p>

<h3><b>Waterfall Model:</b> </h3>
Introduced by Winston Royce in 1970 and is currently the most commonly used model for small software.<p>

Emphasizes that software is developed in sequential phases 
(plan-> Analyze->Design->Build->Test->Development) with established milestones, documents and reviews at end of each phase.

		<div class="da-img">
                <img src="../../testing/manual_testing/img/sdlc1.jpg" alt="image01" />
        </div>
<br>
<p>Traditional waterfall model a one-way linear sequence.<p>

			<h3>Strengths:</h3><p>
			<p>1. Simple to understand and use.</p>
			<p>2. Clearly defined stages.</p>
			<p>3. Well understood milestones and easy to arrange tasks.</p>
			<p>4. Process and results are well documented.</p>
			<p>5. Works well for projects where requirements are well understood.</p>
<h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
<p>1. Requirements must be fully specified at the beginning.</p>
<p>2. Cannot accommodate changing arguments.</p>
<p>3. Not suitable for complex projects.</p>
<p>4. Users can only judge at the end.</p>
<h3><b>Prototyping model:</b></h3>
Usually used in projects where general objectives for software are known, but one cannot identify detailed requirements.
Based on IKIWISI(I-Know-It-When-I-see-It) principle.

		<div class="da-img">
                <img src="../../testing/manual_testing/img/sdlc2.jpg" alt="image01" />
        </div>

			<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;	Customer can see the system requirements as they are being gathered.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; Interaction with the prototype stimulates awareness of additional needed functionality.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; It serves as a marketing tool.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; Improves communication between developers & customers.</p>

<h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; Hard to plan the entire project at once leading to difficulties.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;	May encourage excess of change requests.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;	Overall maintainability may be overlooked.</p>

<h3><b>Incremental Model</b></h3><p>
It is a type of evolutionary model
This objective is to develop the system in incremental parts. Requirements are prioritized and then implemented in groups &quot;divide and conquer&quot;
Each subsequent release of the system adds function the previous release until all designed functionality has been implemented.

		<div class="da-img">
                <img src="../../testing/manual_testing/img/sdlc3.jpg" alt="image01" />
        </div>
		<br><p>Increments continue until all functionality is implemented.</p>
		
			<h3>Advantages:</h3><p>
<p>1. Some working functionality can be developed quickly & early in the life cycle.
<p>2. Results are obtained early and parallel development can be planned.
<p>3. Less costly to change the scope/requirements
<p>4. Delivers an operational product with each release.
<h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
<p>1. Although the cost of change is lesser it is not very suitable for changing requirements.</p>
<p>2. Requires good planning and design and careful partitioning of the product.</p>
<p>3. Requires early definition of a fully functional product to define the requirements.</p>

		<h3><b>Spiral Model</b></h3><p>
		Evolutionary model that combines the interactive nature of prototyping with the controlled and systematic aspects of waterfall life cycle model, along with an aspect of waterfall life cycle model, 
		along with an emphasis on the use of risk management techniques
		After all the risks have been addressed, the spiral model terminates as a waterfall life cycle.

                <img src="../../testing/manual_testing/img/sdlc4.jpg" alt="image01" />
        </div>
		
	<p>	It is an iteration of four stages.
<p>1. Planning: Identifying the objectives, alternatives, constraints for an iteration i.e; gather requirements for this iteration.
<p>2. Risk Analysis: Identify and analyze risks. Use prototyping, simulations, bench marking and other risk resolution techniques to determine to GO/NO GO for the project.
<p>3. Development and test: If GO, then build the increment of the system.
<p>4. Get Evaluation and feedback/suggestions from sponsors.
<h3>Strengths:</h3><p>
<p>1. Flexibility and accommodation to changes.
<p>2. Ability to integrate new technology and architectures
<p>3. Ability to react to risks at each evolutionary level.
<p>4. The Software is produced early in the software lifecycle.


<h3>Drawbacks:</h3><p>
<p>1. More complex planning and management process.</p>
<p>2. Cost can be high.</p>
<p>3. Doesn&rsquo;t work well for small projects.</p>
<p>4. Risk assessment requires highly specific expertise.</p>



	<h3><b>V-Model (Verification and Validation model) </b></h3><p>
	A Variant of the waterfall that emphasizes verification and validation of the product.
	Testing of the product is planned with a corresponding phase of development. 
	Assumes that approximately half of the total development effort will be spent in testing.

        </div>
		
		
<p>		<b>Verification:</b><p>  Verification is testing to confirm that a product complies with its requirements and specifications. It is also called as Unconventional testing.
<p>The standard definition of Verification goes like this: "Are we building the product RIGHT?" i.e. Verification is a process that makes it sure that the software product is developed the right way. 
 The software should conform to its predefined specifications, as the product development goes through different stages, an analysis is done to ensure that all required specifications are met.
<p>During the Verification, the work product (the ready part of the Software being developed and various documentations) is reviewed/examined personally by one or more persons in order to find and point out the defects in it. 
This process helps in prevention of potential bugs, which may cause failure of the project.
<p><b>Validation:</b> <p>
Validation is testing to confirm that it satisfies stakeholder needs. It is also called as Conventional testing.
<p>Validation is a process of finding out if the product being built is right? i.e. whatever the software product is being developed, it should do what the user expects it to do. 
The software product should functionally do what it is supposed to, it should satisfy all the functional requirements set by the user. 
<p>Validation is done during or at the end of the development process in order to determine whether the product satisfies specified requirements.



<p><b>V-Model Strengths</b>
<p>&bull; Emphasizes on planning, verification, and validation in early stages of development
<p>&bull; Rigorous testing efforts
<p>&bull; Easy to use and Easy to track progress
<p>&bull; Works well for projects where requirements are well understood.
<p><b>V-Model Drawbacks:</b>
<p>&bull; 	No iteration phases
<p>&bull; 	Does not easily handle changes in requirements
<p>&bull; 	Does not contain risk analysis activities
<p>&bull; 	If any changes happen in midway, then the test documents along with  required documents have to be updated

<h3><b>RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)</b></h3>
<p>Developed to respond to the need of delivering systems very fast. It is a methodology for compressing the Analysis, design, build and test phases into as series of short, iterative development cycles 
Usually used with object-oriented programming such as Java, C++.
<p>It uses time boxing, where some features are pushed to a future release in order to complete the current version Quickly.

        </div>
		
		<p><p><b>Strengths:</b>
<p>&bull;	Time to deliver is less.
<p>&bull;	Changing requirements can be accommodated.
<p>&bull;	Progress can be measured.
<p>&bull;	Cycle time can be short with use of powerful RAD tools.
<p>&bull;	Use of tools and frameworks.
<p><b>Drawbacks:</b>
<p>&bull;	Management complexity is more.
<p>&bull;	Resource requirements are more.
<p>&bull;	Suitable for systems that are component based.
<p>&bull;	Requires user involvement throughout the life cycle.

		
		<h3><b>Agile Model</b></h3>
		<p>Agile: Readiness for motion, quick activity, cleverness in motion.</p>
		It is a conceptual framework for software engineering that promotes development iterations throughout the life-cycle of the project. Software developed during one unit of time is referred to as an iteration, which may be lost from one to four weeks. Agile methods also emphasize working software as the primary measure of progress.


<p>Why More IT Companies use Agile model?
<p>Agile approaches, organizations can respond swiftly to customer needs, speed solution delivery and adapt efficiently to change.
<p>Agile Model need:
<p>Improved quality
<p>More opportunities for mid-course corrections
<p>Improved customer or business satisfaction
<p>Better alignment between business and IT
<p>Improved time to market
<p>This methodology follows neither a purely sequential approach nor does it follow a purely iterative approach. 
It is a selective mix of both of these approaches in addition to quite a few new developmental methods. 
Fast and incremental development is one of the key principles of this methodology. The focus is on obtaining quick, practical and visible outputs and results, rather than merely following theoretical processes. 
Continuous customer interaction and participation is an integral part of the entire development process.
<p>Existing Agile methods are<p>
<p>i.	Scrum
<p>ii.	Extreme programming
<p>iii.	Agile unified process
<p>iv.	Crystal methodologies & family
<p>v.	Features driven development
<p>vi.	Adaptive software development
<p>SCRUM: It is a very light framework for delivering real products early often consistently.

        </div>
		
<p><b>Advantages:</b>
<p>&bull;	It has an adaptive team which is able to respond to the changing requirements. 
<p>&bull;	Face to face communications and continues inputs from the customer representatives leaves no space for guess work.
<p>&bull;	Documentation is crisp and to the point to save time.
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b>
<p>&bull;	There is a lack of emphasis on the necessary designing and documentation.
<p>&bull;	The project can easily get taken off track. If customer representative is not clear. What final outcome that they want.
<p>&bull;	Only Senior Programmers are capable of taking the exact kind of decisions, required during the development process.
