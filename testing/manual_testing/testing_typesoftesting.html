				<p>
                  Various software testing methodologies guide you through the consecutive software testing types.To determine the true functionality of the application being tested, test cases are designed to help the developers.
				  Test cases provide you with the guidelines for going through the process of testing the software. Software testing includes two basic types of software testing, viz. Manual Scripted Testing and Automated Testing.
				  
				</p>
               
     
		<p> <h3>Manual Scripted Testing:</h3> This is considered to be one of the oldest type of software testing methods, in which test cases are designed and reviewed by the team, before executing it. 
		<p> <h3> Automated Testing: </h3> This software testing type applies automation in the testing, which can be applied to various parts of a software process such as test case management, executing test cases, defect management, reporting of the bugs/defects.</p>
		The bug life cycle helps the tester in deciding how to log a bug and also guides the developer to decide on the priority of the bug depending upon the severity of logging it. Software bug testing or software testing to log a bug, explains the contents of a bug that is to be fixed.
		This can be done with the help of various bug tracking tools such as Bugzilla and defect tracking management tools. </p>
           
<p><h3>Black Box Testing:</h3> It explains the process of giving the input to the system and checking the output, without considering how the system generates the output. It is also called as Behavioral Testing. </p>
<p><h3>Functional Testing:</h3> In this type of testing, the software is tested for the functional requirements. This checks whether the application is behaving according to the specification. </p>
<p><h3>Performance Testing:</h3> This type of testing checks whether the system is performing properly, according to the user's requirements. </p>
<p> Performance testing depends upon the Load and Stress Testing, that is internally or externally applied to the system.
<p> 1. Load Testing : In this type of performance testing, the system is raised beyond the limits in order to check the performance of the system when higher loads are applied.
<p> 2. Stress Testing : In this type of performance testing, the system is tested beyond the normal expectations or operational capacity
<p>&bull; Usability Testing: This type of testing is also called as 'Testing for User Friendliness'. This testing checks the ease of use of an application. </p>

<p>&bull; Parallel Testing: Parallel testing is done by comparing results from two different systems like old vs new or manual vs automated. </p>
<p>&bull; Recovery Testing: Recovery testing is very necessary to check how fast the system is able to recover against any hardware failure, catastrophic problems or any type of system crash. </p>
<p>&bull; Installation Testing: This type of software testing identifies the ways in which installation procedure leads to incorrect results.</p> 
<p>&bull; Compatibility Testing: Compatibility Testing determines if an application under supported configurations perform as expected, with various combinations of hardware and software packages. </p>
<p>&bull; Configuration Testing: This testing is done to test for compatibility issues. It determines minimal and optimal configuration of hardware and software, and determines the effect of adding or modifying resources such as memory, disk drives and CPU.</p> 
<p>&bull; Compliance Testing: This type of testing checks whether the system was developed in accordance with standards, procedures and guidelines.</p>
<p>&bull; Error-Handling Testing: This software testing type determines the ability of the system to properly process erroneous transactions.</p>
<p>&bull; Manual-Support Testing: This type of software testing is an interface between people and application system.</p>
<p>&bull; Inter-Systems Testing: This type of software testing method is an interface between two or more application systems.</p>

<p>&bull; Volume Testing: This testing is done, when huge amount of data is processed through the application.</p>
<p>&bull; Scenario Testing: This type of software testing provides a more realistic and meaningful combination of functions, rather than artificial combinations that are obtained through domain or combinatorial test design.
<p>&bull; Mutation Testing: In this type of software testing, the application is tested for the code that was modified after fixing a particular bug/defect.
<p>Levels of Testing:
These are the Levels of testing or testing phases
<p>&bull; Unit Testing: Developers concentrate on unit testing to check the program logic and structure with the help of white box testing Techniques.</p>
<p>&bull; Integration Testing: Integrating all individual modules or component together to make it as a complete system.
<p>&bull; System Testing:  It is done by testers, to check the behaviour of a complete integrated software product based on requirement and specifications.
<p>&bull; User Acceptance testing: It is done by QA team, they will check whether the application meets the intended specifications and client requirements.
It can be done in two ways Alpha Testing and Beta Testing.
<p> 1. Alpha Testing: During this testing we invite customers to the organisation giving training on the application under customer expected configuration and collect feedback from the customer. The focus of this testing is to stimulate the application and collect feedback. It is done for projects.
<p> 2. Beta Testing: During this testing responsible team goes to the customers place and there gives training on the application and collect feedback about the application. It is performed by real users and It is done for products.</p>
<p> Functional testing: During this testing testers are checking functionality of the application</p>

<p>&bull; 	GUI Coverage: Testers check the valid changes in the properties of object or window. Like Buttons, Edit box, List box, radio button, check box.
<p>&bull; 	Error Handling: Testers are checking wrong operations that are handled by system or by providing meaningful error or suggestion messages.
<p>&bull; 	Input domain coverage: Testers use Black box testing Techniques like ECP & BVA to decide range and type of the specification.
<p>&bull; 	Manipulation/Output Coverage: Testers are checking the output of the application. Determine the existing output as expected.
<p>&bull; 	Back end/Database Coverage: Testers are checking the impact of front end operations on back end table checking the insert, update, delete operations of application in database tables.
<p>&bull; 	System integration Testing: Testing an application interaction with other application's interface.
<p> Non Functional Testing: After Completion of Functional testing Testers are concentrating on extra features or extra characteristics of the application.
<p>&bull; Reliability Testing: Software will not cause the failure of the system for a specified time under specified conditions.
<p>&bull; Compatibility Testing: Testing the functionality of the application on different hardware and software environments.
<p>&bull; Portability Testing: Testing the functionality of the application on different operating systems
<p>&bull; 	Performance Testing: Test the performance of the software in the defined conditions with the focus on responsiveness.
<p>&bull; Volume Testing: Test the stability of the system by processing huge amount of data.
<p>&bull; Soak Testing: It is done by application significant load over a extended period of time to see how system behaves
<p>&bull; Security Testing: It is used to find-out all the potential loopholes and weakness of the system. It ensures that the system and application used by the organization are secure and not exposed to any type of attack.
<p>&bull; Localization Testing: It is done to test the application supports different local languages such as Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam etc.
<p>&bull; Internationalization Testing: It is done to test the application supports different international languages such as Dutch, French etc
<p>&bull; Installation/Un-installation Testing: Test all supporting files are being installed/un-installed successfully or not.
<p>&bull; Accessibility Testing: Testing that the application is accessible by everyone or not.
<p>&bull;Sanitation Testing: Testers detect the extra functionality which are not specified by customers.
